# Obsidian Image Width Slider Plugin
> A plugin for Obsidian that allows you to adjust the width of images in the current note using a simple slider in the status bar.

-## Features

- Adjust the width of images using a slider in the status bar.
- Increase or decrease image sizes to customize your viewing experience.
- Simple and intuitive interface for easy usage.
- Choose between percent, pixel, or viewport units for the slider.

### Feature: Custom for Individual Files using YAML

With the Obsidian Image Width Slider Plugin, you can customize image widths for individual files by specifying an "image-width" field in the YAML frontmatter of your notes. This feature allows you to have different image widths for different files, giving you greater flexibility in your note-taking and editing experience. The width value respects the unit configured in the plugin settings.

#### Setting the Image Width

To set a custom image width for a specific file, follow these steps:

1. Open the note for which you want to customize the image width.

2. In the YAML frontmatter section at the top of the note, add an "image-width" field. The value of this field should be a number. It will use the unit selected in the plugin settings. For example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: My Customized Note
   image-width: 75
   ---
   ```
   The above example sets the width to 75 using the unit selected in the plugin settings.
